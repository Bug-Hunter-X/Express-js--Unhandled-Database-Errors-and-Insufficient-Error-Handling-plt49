# Express.js: Unhandled Database Errors and Insufficient Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling during database interactions.  The provided code lacks robust error handling, which can lead to unexpected server crashes or unhelpful error messages for clients.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that creates a new user.  However, it includes minimal error handling for database operations. If the database operation fails, the server might crash or send a vague error message to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents an improved version with enhanced error handling.  It distinguishes between various error types, logs more informative messages, and sends specific HTTP error codes to the client, improving both the application's robustness and the user experience.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Run the application: `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the solution)

Note: Replace the placeholder database interaction (`db.createUser`) with your actual database library.
